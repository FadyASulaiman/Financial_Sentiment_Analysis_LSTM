To approach this project, I researched scholarly artcles and journals to find a precident of using LSTM architecture with financial sentiment analysis.

This folder contains the papers I referenced during my work on this project.

The papers are Cited here arranged by magnitude of usefullness.


3. Improving sentiment analysis of financial news headlines using hybrid Word2Vec-TFIDF feature extraction technique. Meera Georgea, Dr. R. Murugesanb. (Section 3: methodology has everything you need to kmow abot the approach ... the paper evaluates the performance of different feature extraction techniques- (Word2Vec, TFIDF, Doc2Vec, hybrid Word2Vec-TFIDF, hybrid Doc2Vec-TFIDF) ... PLus in the same section you will find a reference to a promininet kaggle dataset to use )

6. Sentiment Analysis of Financial News Articles using Performance Indicators. Srikumar Krishnamoorthy. (Pointed towards good datasets, provided guidance on data preprocessing)
7. Financial sentiment analysis: Classic methods vs. deep learning models. Aikaterini Karanikola, Gregory Davrazos, Charalampos M. Liapis and Sotiris Kotsiantis. (Very Helpful actually for understanding the usage of BERT, RoBERTa, FinBERT). (Olus directed me towards a very importna dataset on kaggle)
