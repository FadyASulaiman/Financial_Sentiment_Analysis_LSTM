# structuring this project all over again
"""
What are the pieces that need to be built for this project to succeed:

1. Data acquisition: The papers mentioned that they had data over 10,000 examples, this amount is supposed to be publicly accessible.
2. Data cleaning & Preprocessing: The neccessary cleaning for the data would be:
    - Removing punctution marks (!, ?, ., :, ;, ,)
    - Removing HTML tags (<>) (unlikely to happen in this corpus)
    - Remove links (https://)
    - Remove special chars ((, ), +, -, =, \, |, {, }, [, ])
    - lowercasing
    - Stop word removal
    - Handle Currency symbols (Â£$) maybe with a token like <CUR>
    - lemmatization & stemming
    - tokenization
3. Data augmentation: possible if we need more training data for the model to perform better
4. Feature engineering: feature engineering should not be hard for this dataset

5. model structure:
    - We are using an LSTM model
    - Embeddigns layer
    - Input layer
    - LSTM layer
    - Dropout layer (for regularization & to prevent overfitting)
    - LSTM layer
    - Output layer (with ReLU activation)
    - loss function: Categorical crossentropy
    - metric: accuracy
    - Optimizer: Adam

6. Hyperparameters used

7. Epochs: 3 to 10 

8. Pipelining:
    - For generalization, we must create a pipeline where the test data would also go through
    - including:
        - preprocessing
        - Transformers (Via pickle)

9. Train/Test/CV split: 70%/15%/15%
10. Deployment:
    - Cloud provider: GCP
    - Containerization: yes, docker.
    - Container deployment: Google Cloud run
    - Versioning: Artifact registry
    - database: CloudSQL
    - frontend: Gradio, through a very cheap web-host.
    - personal website: No.
    - CI/CD: No.

11. Experiment Tracking and lifecycle: MLflow
12. Showcasing: Canva, through a video demo
13. Writeup: Throughout the project we have to document everything to make the writeup easier.
